            <br />
            Air pollution is compossed of air particles that fall back to earth
            cuasing serious harm, to humans, plants, and even buildings. People
            experience a very wide range of health effects from air pollutants,
            with short-term effects being: <br />
            * Pneumonia<br />
            * Bronchitis<br />
            * Nausea<br /><br />
            Long term effects being:<br />
            * Heart Disease<br />
            * Lung Cancer<br />
            * Emphysema<br /><br />
            The environment is not safe from the pollution, entire ecosystems
            are suffering and facing extinction, contaminating water, soil,
            killing crops and reducing their yield drastically.
